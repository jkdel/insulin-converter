# Equine Insulin Converter

Equine Insulin Converter is a [simple and free online tool](https://www.equine-insulin-converter.org/)
to convert insulin measurements between assays, allowing to compare values published based on data obtained
using other assays with your own measurements.

This app may be useful to veterinary practioners and researchers interested in equine endocrinology.
However, it also demonstrates a way of making statistical and mathematical models accessible to readers of
your scientific publications at almost no cost.

[The methodology and use of the app were recently published](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/17/2704)
in a peer-reviewed open access journal.
